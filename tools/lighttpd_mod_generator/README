Module that can be used to create dynamic http responses.  Good for using as an origin server when benchmarking.

Format of the URL:
http://server:port/bytes-id-sleeptime-{cache|no_cache}

bytes            - number of bytes for the response body
id               - arbitrary id that can be used for uniqueness
sleeptime        - milliseconds lighttpd should sleep before sending a response
{cache|no_cache} - add headers to make the response cacheable or not

Example URLs:
URL to test the caching of ATS, 1KB body and don't delay the response
http://myserver.com:8080/1024-123-0-cache

URL to test the proxying of ATS, 2KB body and delay the response for 1ms
http://myserver.com:8080/2048-123-1-no_cache
